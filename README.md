# What is synchronization?
Synchronization is needed to store your collection of favorites, history and categories and have remote access to them. On a synchronized device, you can restore your manga collection in real time without loss. It also supports working across multiple devices. It is convenient for those who use several devices.

 - Synchronization starts. The data selected by the user is saved on the service and stored there under protection;
 - Another device connects and syncs with the service.
 - The uploaded data appears on the device connected to the account.
