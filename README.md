## What is synchronization?
Synchronization is needed to store your collection of favorites, history and categories and have remote access to them. On a synchronized device, you can restore your manga collection in real time without loss. It also supports working across multiple devices. It is convenient for those who use several devices.

## How does synchronization work?
 - An account is created and configured in the application where it will store data;
 - Synchronization starts. The data selected by the user is saved on the service and stored there under protection;
 - Another device connects and syncs with the service;
 - The uploaded data appears on the device connected to the account.

## What data can be synchronized?
 - Favorites (with categories);
 - History.

## How do I sync my data?
Go to `Options -> Settings -> Services`, then select **Synchronization**. Enter your email address (even if you have not registered in the synchronization system, the authorization screen also acts as a registration screen), then come up with and enter a password.

    ATTENTION: there is no password recovery from the account at the moment,
	if you forget the password, you will not be able to log into your account on other
	devices, so we recommend that you do not forget the password or write it down somewhere.

After the authorization/registration process, you will return back to the **Content** screen. To set up synchronization, select **Synchronization** again, and then you will go to system sync settings. Choose what you want to sync, history, favorites or all together, after which automatic synchronization to our server will begin.

## Can I use a synchronization server on my hosting?
Yes, you can use your synchronization server in the application by specifying its address (`Options -> Settings -> Services -> Synchronization settings -> Server address`). Instructions for deploying the server are below.

## Installation
### Database schema

Before deploying the sync server, you have to run the SQL script to setup the schema for your MySQL database:

	mysql -h hostname -u user database < ./database.mysql.sql

or Postgresql one:

	psql -U user database < ./database.postgresql.sql

### Docker
Build image container:

    docker build github.com/KotatsuApp/kotatsu-syncserver.git -t kotatsuapp/syncserver

Run container:

    docker run -d -p 8081:8080 \
	-e DATABASE_HOST=your_mysql_db_host \
	-e DATABASE_USER=your_mysql_db_user \
	-e DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_mysql_db_password \
	-e DATABASE_NAME=your_mysql_db_name \
 	-e DATABASE_PORT=your_mysql_db_port \
	-e JWT_SECRET=your_secret \
	-e ALLOW_NEW_REGISTER=true \
	--restart always \
	--name kotatsu-sync kotatsuapp/syncserver

In case you don't want others to use your instance, register your accounts then set `ALLOW_NEW_REGISTER` to `false`.

To use Postgresql, following additional env are needed:

    -e DATABASE_PORT=5432 \
    -e DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql

### Systemd
Requirements:
- JDK 11+
- Gradle 7.0+

Commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/KotatsuApp/kotatsu-syncserver.git
    $ cd kotatsu-syncserver && ./gradlew shadowJar

Then edit file `kotatsu-sync.service`, change `replaceme` fields with your values (MySQL is used for database) and specify the `kotatsu-syncserver-0.0.1.jar` file location (it can be found in `build/libs` directory after buliding)

	$ cp kotatsu-sync.service /etc/systemd/system
	$ systemctl enable kotatsu-sync
  	$ systemctl daemon-reload
	$ systemctl start kotatsu-sync

That's all :)
